I need to go through all the functions to make sure the permission are correct
create modifiers
make sure the approvals are correct
think about constructors
when addresses and contracts are required make sure they are updated correctly from constructors or activation functions
Make a simple deploy sequence, perhaps a deployment contract?


Once deployed configure collabland
test images and metadata
make sure functions are there to update images and metadata
have sensible metadata and test images to go before showing to anyone

Create Reactapp
make sure its nice with the new features such as automatically switching chains and showing you you are connected.
use bootstrap for front end
Front End - link to discord, greet current holder, give price, purchase button, greet person who connects their wallet, current price of token, uniswap applet

Configure and run tests
